># What is Base64
## Fundamentally, Base64 is used to encode binary data as printable text. This allows you to transport binary over protocols or mediums that cannot handle binary data formats and require simple text.
># What is the input file?
## An input file is one from which a program reads information. It can contain data records, arrays, or tables, or it can be a record-address file.
># FileReader()
## The FileReader object allows web applications to asynchronously read the contents of files (or data buffers) stored on the user's computer, using  File or Blob objects that specify the file or data to be read.
># FileReader: readAsDataURL() method
## The readAsDataURL method of the FileReader interface is used to read the contents of the specified Blob or File. When the read operation is finished, the readyState becomes DONE, and the loadend is triggered. At that time, the result attribute contains the data as a data: URL representing the file's data as a base64 encoded string.
># FileReader: result property
## The FileReader result property returns the file's contents. This property is only valid after the read operation is complete, and the format of the data depends on which of the methods was used to initiate the read operation"# User-list-and-slider-using-fetch-and-axios"
